Bid preparation costs
-  This variable measures the cost of preparing	to b if (cost of plans, talking to subcontractors, etc). This variable is from a sample of bidding documents

Common contractor use
- Data is from a sample of bidding documents. Used to see if there is a coloration between costs and common contractors use. 
Small business preference program (sbpref on the data set)
- Used to see which of the bidders participated in the small business preference program

Engineers estimate  (estimate in the data set)
- This variable is Caltran’s estimate of the project costs. This variable is used to see if the estimated cost of the project impacts a firms bid amount.

Working days (workdays in dataset)
- The paper doesn’t describe this variable in detail this. I assume it is the duration for the project

Work Catagories (cat1-cat4 in the data set)
- Spilt projects into 5 categories: bridge work, landscaping, road repair, signs signals and lighting, small building work. The paper uses this to see if the type of project impacts the costs of the firm.

Number of small plan holders  (sbplanh in the data set) - The number of small companies who purchase the plan documents. The paper uses this as the number of firms that plan to bid.

 Number of large plan holders  (lgplanh in the data set)
- The number of large companies who purchase the plan documents. The paper uses this as the number of firms that plan to bid.

Number of small bidders  (sbnum in the data set)
- This variable measures the number of small firms that place a bid on a project

Number of large bidders = (lbnum in the data set)
- This variable measures the number of large firms that place a bid on a project

Size of the project (small and medium in data set)
- This variable measures the size of the project being bid on. The paper uses this to see if the participation of small firms and large firms varies depending on the size of the project.

Rural and Urban districts (I assume its d1-d11 but it could be m1-m11)
-  This variable looks that the administrative district the project is in. Rural districts North Central, South Central, or Southern Sierra districts.

2.
A) The paper uses the number of firms the buy project plans from Caltrans
B) Variables in the paper
- Small business program participants as sbpref
- Engineers estimate as estimate 
- Working days as workdays
- Work categories as cat1-cat4
- Number of small plan holders sbplanh
- Number of large plan holders lgbplanh
- Number of small bidders sbnum
- Number of large bidders lgnum
- Size of project as small and medium
- Administrative district as d1-d11 but was split into rural and urban

C) Variables not in data set
-  Bid preparation costs
- Common contractor use (or just contractor use)

D) Missing variables from the paper
- m1-m11
- y1-y3
-proj_id and co_id but they are probably not relevant to the analysis
